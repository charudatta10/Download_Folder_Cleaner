# Quick Start Demo

![Demo Preview](https://source.unsplash.com/random/1280x720)

I believe that you should bring value to the reader as soon as possible. You should be able to get the user up and running with your project with minimal friction.

If you have a quickstart guide, this is where it should be.

Alternatively, you can add a demo to show what your project can do.


# Installation


> **Note**: For longer README files, I usually add a "Back to top" buttton as shown above. It makes it easy to navigate.

This is where your installation instructions go.

You can add snippets here that your readers can copy-paste with click:

```shell
gh repo clone charudatta10/improved-barnacle
```

 
# Usage

Next, you have to explain how to use your project. You can create subsections under here to explain more clearly.

***Visuals***
screenshots or  video 


# Support

Tell people where they can go to for help. It can be any combination of an issue tracker, a chat room, an email address, etc.

# Roadmap

If you have ideas for releases in the future, it is a good idea to list them in the README.

 
# Development

You have people who want to use your project and then you have people who want contribute to your project.

This is where you provide instructions for the latter.

Add instructions on how to set up a development environment, clone, and build the project.

You can use the code snippets here as well:

```shell
command to clone your project
command to build your project
command to run your project in development mode
```

# Authors and Contribution guide

Show your appreciation to those who have contributed to the project.

You can use this section to highlight how people can contribute to your project.

You can add information on how they can open issues or how they can sponsor the project.


 
# License

For open source projects, say how it is [licensed](/licesce).
